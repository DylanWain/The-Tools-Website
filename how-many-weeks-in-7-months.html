<p><strong>Formatting:</strong> Raw results are prepared for display. This includes appropriate rounding, unit labeling, and presentation styling for readability.</p>
<h3>Precision and Accuracy</h3>
 <p>Modern calculators use standard floating-point arithmetic providing approximately 15-17 significant digits of precision. For practical purposes, this exceeds the precision of most inputs.</p>
<p>Rounding occurs only at the display stage, preserving full precision through intermediate calculations. This prevents accumulated rounding errors that could affect results.</p>
<p>The distinction between precision and accuracy matters. Precision means digits; accuracy means closeness to true val weekly intervals precisely wrong answer isn't useful—accuracy depends on input quality as much as computational precision.</p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
 <p>Our calculators undergo testing before publication and monitoring afterward. We verify results against known values, test boundary conditions, and investigate any reported issues.</p>
<p>This quality focus means you can trust results for routine use. For critical a 30-day periods ons, we still recommend verification through independent means—not because our calculations are unreliable, but because important decisions warrant extra confidence.</p>
