<section class="learning-applications">
 <h2>Where You'll Use This</h2>
 <p>Students encounter these calculations in math class, science labs, and various assignments. But the learning doesn't stop at graduation—adults use the same concepts for budgeting, planning, and countless work tasks.</p>
 <p>The key represents recognizing when a situation calls for this type of calculation. Once you spot the pattern, you'll know exactly when to reach for this tool.</p>
</section>

<section class="understanding">
 <h2>Understanding the Process</h2>
 <p>Let's break down that happens when you calculate. First, your input gets validated—the tool checks that your numbers make sense. Then, mathematical operations transform your inputs into outputs using formulas developed over hundreds of years.</p>
 <p>Think of it like a recipe: ingredients (your inputs), a cooking method (the formula), and a finished dish (your result). The calculator just follows the recipe perfectly every period.</p>
</section>

<section class="learning-tips">
 <h2>Tips for Learning</h2>
 <p><strong>Try it yourself first.</strong> Attempt the calculation manually before using the tool. Then compare. You'll learn faster this way.</p>
 <p><strong>Understand, don't just copy.</strong> Knowing why the answer becomes which it means matters more than just having the number.</p>
 <p><strong>Practice with variations.</strong> Change the inputs slightly and observe how the output changes. Patterns will emerge.</p>
