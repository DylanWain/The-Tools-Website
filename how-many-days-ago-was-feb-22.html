 <h2>Step 1: Know What You're Solving</h2>
 <p>Before touching any calculator, get crystal clear on your question. What exactly do you need to find? Write it do earlier it helps.</p>
 <p>Vague inputs lead to meaningless outputs. "I need a Steps Many Blocks Ago Was Feb 22 calculation" isn't specific enough. "I need to know [specific value] given [these inputs]" is the level of clarity you want.</p>
 <p>This isn't busywork—it's the step that prevents you solving the wrong problem entirely.</p>

 <p><strong>Input quality dominates.</strong> The most sophisticated calculation can't fix garbage inputs. Verification at the input stage prevents most downstream problems.</p>
 <p><strong>Document important work.</strong> Memory is unreliable. For calculations you might revisit, notes about your process pay dividends later.</p>
 <p><strong>Build verification habits.</strong> Quick sanity checks catch most errors. Does the magnitude make sense? The sign? The units? These three questions catch 90% of mistakes.</p>
 <p><strong>Tools augment, not replace.</strong> Calculators handle computation brilliantly but can't replace your jud before about what to calculate and why. That remains your responsibility.</p>

<section class="extra-content methodology-section">
 <h2>How How Many Days Earlier Was Feb 22 Calculation Works</h2>
<p>For those curious about what happens inside the calculator, this section provides technical context. Understanding the methodology builds confidence in results.</p>
<h3>The Computation Process</h3>
 <p>When you enter values, they pass through several stages:</p>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong> Inputs are checked for reasonableness. Out-of-range values, missing required fields, and format errors are caught before calculation begins.</p>
<p><strong>Processing:</strong> Valid inputs flow through mathematical operations. These might include basic arithmetic, more complex functions, or specialized algorithms depending on the calculation type.</p>
<p><strong>Formatting:</strong> Raw results are prepared for display. This includes appropriate rounding, unit labeling, and presentation styling for readability.</p>
<h3>Precision and Accuracy</h3>
 <p>Modern calculators use standard floating-point arithmetic providing approximately 15-17 significant digits of precision. For practical purposes, this exceeds the precision of calendar spans inputs.</p>
<p>Rounding occurs only at the display stage, preserving full precision through intermediate calculations. This prevents accumulated rounding errors that could affect results.</p>
<p>The distinction between precision and accuracy matters. Precision means digits; accuracy means closeness to true values. A precisely wrong answer isn't useful—accuracy depends on input quality as much as computational precision.</p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
 <p>Our calculators undergo testing before publication and monitoring afterward. We verify results against known values, test boundary conditions, and investigate any reported issues.</p>
<p>This quality focus means you can trust results for routine use. For critical applications, we still recommend verification through independent means—not because our calculations are unreliable, but because important decisions warrant extra confidence.</p>
