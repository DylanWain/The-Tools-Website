 <h2>Your Radical Calculator Questions, Answered Directly</h2>
 <p>Quick question: how often do you deal with Radical Calculator? Rather than burying answers in paragraphs, let's address your questions head-on.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-qa">
 <h2>"Why can't I just calculate Radical Calculator in my head?"</h2>
 <p>You probably can—for simple cases. The issue is cognitive load. Mental math uses working memory that could go toward understanding what the result means rather than computing it.</p>
 <p>Think of it like spelling: you could sound out every word, but using that brain power for comprehension serves you better. Same principle applies to Radical Calculator calculations.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-qa">
 <h2>"What if I need to explain my Radical Calculator calculation to someone else?"</h2>
 <p>Good question—and a situation where understanding the process matters. You'll want to show your work, not just the final number.</p>
 <p>Keep notes: what inputs you used, what method you followed, what the result was. This documentation makes your work transparent and auditable when needed.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-qa">
 <h2>"How do I know the Radical Calculator result is actually right?"</h2>
 <p>Verification strategies, in order of effort: (1) Does it pass the smell test? (2) Can you estimate roughly to check? (3) Does a different method give the same answer? (4) Can someone else verify?</p>
 <p>For routine calculations, step 1 usually suffices. For high-stakes decisions, go further down the list.</p>
